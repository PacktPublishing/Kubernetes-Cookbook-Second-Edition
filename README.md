# Kubernetes-Cookbook-Second-Edition
This is the code repository for [Kubernetes Cookbook - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/kubernetes-cookbook-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788837606), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Kubernetes is an open source solution to manage containers in clustered environments. With Kubernetes, you can configure and deploy your containerized workloads easily. This book will show you how. You’ll get a quick brush up on how Kubernetes works with containers, and an overview of the main Kubernetes features such as Pods, Deployments, Services, and more.

You’ll be able to create Kubernetes clusters and run applications on Kubernetes with proper authentication and authorization strategies. With real-world recipes, you’ll explore a high availability Kubernetes master setup, use Kubernetes with Docker, and set up Kubernetes on AWS, GCP, or an on-premise environment. You’ll also discover useful recipes on integrating with a continuous delivery pipeline, logging, and monitoring.

Upon completion of this book, you’ll be able to use Kubernetes in production and will have a better understanding of how to manage your containers using Kubernetes.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter01.



The code will look like the following:
```
pipelining=True
ansible_ssh_common_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=30m -o ConnectionAttempts=100
control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
forks = 50

```
